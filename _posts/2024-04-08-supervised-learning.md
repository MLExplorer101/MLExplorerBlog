# Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning is a Machine Learning technique that uses labelled data(aka training dataset) to make predictions.
It uses a training set to teach models to provide the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.
